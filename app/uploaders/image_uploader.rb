  # Create different versions of your uploaded files:
  # version :thumb do
  #   process resize_to_fit: [50, 50]

  # Add a white list of extensions which are allowed to be uploaded.
  # For images you might use something like this:
  # def extension_whitelist
  #   %w(jpg jpeg gif png)

  # Override the filename of the uploaded files:
  # Avoid using model.id or version_name here, see uploader/store.rb for details.

  #   "something.jpg" if original_filename
